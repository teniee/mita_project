## 🔧 Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue #1: Type Inconsistency in Repository
**Problem**: GoalRepository used `int` for user_id and goal_id parameters, but Goal model uses UUID.

**Solution**:
- Added UUID import to repository
- Changed all `user_id: int` → `user_id: UUID`
- Changed all `goal_id: int` → `goal_id: UUID`

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and verified

### Issue #2: No Automated Verification
**Problem**: No systematic way to verify all components were implemented correctly.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive verification script (verify_module5.py)
- 77 automated checks covering all aspects
- Color-coded output for easy reading

**Status**: ✅ Implemented and passing
