## üîç HOW TO VERIFY AFTER DEPLOYMENT

### 1. Test Production Authentication Speed:
```bash
time curl -X POST "https://mita-production.onrender.com/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "wrongpassword"}'
```
**Expected:** Response in <100ms (not 1548ms like before)

### 2. Check Server Health:
```bash
curl https://mita-production.onrender.com/health
```
**Expected:** 200 OK response

### 3. Verify User Can Login:
- Test with real user credentials
- Should be instant (no 1.5-second delay)
- No authentication timeout errors
