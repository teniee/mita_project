# MITA Finance - Current Problems Checklist

*Last Updated: August 30, 2025*

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Blocking Core Functionality)

### **Authentication System Critical Failures**
- [ ] **FastAPI Auth Router Hangs**: `/api/auth/*` endpoints hang for 60+ seconds due to middleware issues
- [ ] **POST Request Global Failures**: All POST requests get 500 errors from problematic middleware
- [ ] **Async Dependency Injection Deadlocks**: `Depends(get_async_db)` causes infinite hangs
- [ ] **Emergency Auth Dependencies**: Production running on bypass endpoints with reduced security
- [ ] **Middleware Stack Corruption**: Core FastAPI middleware causing systematic failures

### **Security Vulnerabilities** 
- [ ] **Rate Limiting Disabled**: All rate limiting turned off - system vulnerable to attacks
- [ ] **Missing Token Blacklist**: Revoked JWT tokens remain valid until natural expiration
- [ ] **Weak Password Hashing**: Emergency endpoints use 4 bcrypt rounds instead of secure 12+
- [ ] **Audit Logging Disabled**: Security event logging disabled - compliance violations
- [ ] **Authentication Bypass**: Emergency endpoints lack proper security validation

### **Database System Issues**
- [ ] **Connection Pool Misconfiguration**: Pool settings not tested under production load
- [ ] **Async Session Deadlocks**: Database session management causing timeout failures
- [ ] **Migration State**: Alembic migrations may be out of sync with production schema

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MAJOR ISSUES (Significantly Affecting User Experience)

### **Backend API Problems**
- [ ] **Income Classification Inconsistency**: Mixed 3-tier and 5-tier logic across modules
- [ ] **Hardcoded Financial Thresholds**: Legacy values instead of state-specific calculations  
- [ ] **Response Time Degradation**: Regular endpoints taking 8-15+ seconds (masked by emergency fixes)
- [ ] **Error Handling Inconsistency**: Generic vs specific error messages causing user confusion
- [ ] **Feature Flag Chaos**: Multiple features disabled with temporary flags

### **Flutter Mobile App Issues**
- [ ] **Network Timeout Workarounds**: Extended timeouts (30+ seconds) to handle backend slowness
- [ ] **Emergency Service Dependencies**: App hardcoded to use emergency auth instead of proper API
- [ ] **Disabled Error Handling**: Try/catch blocks disabled with "TODO: Re-enable when backend stable"
- [ ] **Loading State Problems**: Extended loading times affecting user experience
- [ ] **Offline Functionality Limited**: Poor experience during backend issues

### **Performance & Scalability**
- [ ] **Database Query Optimization**: Slow queries not properly indexed or optimized
- [ ] **Memory Usage Issues**: High consumption from disabled caching systems
- [ ] **Connection Leak Potential**: Emergency database connections may not be properly pooled
- [ ] **Load Testing Gaps**: No testing of emergency auth system under load

## üîß MINOR ISSUES (Quality of Life Improvements)

### **Code Quality Problems**
- [ ] **Debug Print Pollution**: Extensive print() statements throughout codebase for debugging
- [ ] **Commented Security Code**: Audit logging and monitoring code commented out
- [ ] **TODO Comment Proliferation**: 19+ unimplemented features marked as TODO
- [ ] **Inconsistent Logging**: Mix of print, logging, and disabled logging systems
- [ ] **Emergency Code Proliferation**: Multiple workarounds need consolidation

### **Development Experience**
- [ ] **Environment Configuration**: Emergency configs mixed with production settings
- [ ] **Documentation Outdated**: API docs don't reflect emergency endpoints
- [ ] **Health Check Limitations**: Health checks don't detect middleware problems
- [ ] **Development Setup Complexity**: New developers face authentication setup issues

### **User Interface & Experience**
- [ ] **Error Message Quality**: Generic error messages don't guide user actions
- [ ] **Form Validation Inconsistency**: Different validation patterns across screens
- [ ] **Accessibility Issues**: Some emergency UI lacks proper accessibility support
- [ ] **Visual Feedback Gaps**: Loading states don't reflect actual backend processing

## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL DEBT (Maintenance & Architecture Concerns)

### **Architecture Problems**
- [ ] **Emergency Architecture**: Multiple bypass systems need proper architectural integration
- [ ] **Service Coupling**: Tight coupling between auth and other services causing cascading failures
- [ ] **Mixed Sync/Async Patterns**: Database operations inconsistently implemented
- [ ] **Middleware Complexity**: Overly complex middleware stack needs simplification

### **Testing & Quality Assurance**
- [ ] **Disabled Test Suite**: Multiple tests skipped due to backend instability
- [ ] **Integration Test Failures**: Tests failing due to middleware and auth issues
- [ ] **Security Test Coverage**: Security tests disabled along with security features
- [ ] **Performance Test Absence**: No load testing of emergency auth system

### **Dependency & Configuration Management**
- [ ] **Library Conflicts**: AsyncPG vs psycopg2 resolved but left complexity
- [ ] **Emergency Dependencies**: Added Flask/psycopg2 for emergency fixes need cleanup
- [ ] **Version Management**: Mixed authentication library versions
- [ ] **Configuration Validation**: Missing proper environment variable validation

### **Monitoring & Observability**
- [ ] **Metrics Collection Limited**: Reduced due to disabled middleware
- [ ] **Error Tracking Incomplete**: Sentry integration limited by disabled features
- [ ] **Performance Visibility**: Limited insight into system performance under emergency config
- [ ] **Security Monitoring Gaps**: Security event tracking disabled

## üìã IMMEDIATE ACTION PRIORITIES

### **Phase 1: Core Authentication Fix (Week 1)**
- [ ] Diagnose and fix FastAPI middleware dependency injection root cause
- [ ] Implement proper async database session handling without deadlocks
- [ ] Restore main authentication endpoints (`/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`)

- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end

### **Phase 2: Security Restoration (Week 2)**

- [ ] Restore proper bcrypt configuration (12+ rounds)
- [ ] Re-enable security event logging and audit trails
- [ ] Security audit of emergency endpoints before removal
- [ ] Update authentication documentation

### **Phase 3: Performance & Stability (Week 3)**
- [ ] Fix backend income classification logic inconsistencies
- [ ] Remove hardcoded financial thresholds, implement state-specific logic
- [ ] Database query optimization and proper indexing
