- Mid estimate: $220K × 3.5 = **$770K**
- High estimate: $220K × 5 = **$1.1M**

---

### Method 2: Comparable Company Analysis

**Pre-revenue fintech apps (Seed stage):**
- Basic MVP: $300K - $800K
- Production-ready: $800K - $2M

### Method 3: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

**Assumptions:**
- Discount rate: 30% (high-risk startup)
- Conservative scenario projection
- Terminal value: 15x Year 5 profit

**Calculation:**
```
Year 1: -$67.5K / (1.30)^1 = -$52K
Year 2: $312K / (1.30)^2 = $185K
Year 3: $1.43M / (1.30)^3 = $648K
Year 4: $3.69M / (1.30)^4 = $1.29M
Year 5: $6.8M / (1.30)^5 = $1.83M
Terminal: ($6.8M × 15) / (1.30)^5 = $27.4M

NPV = $31.3M (if achieving conservative projections)
```

**Risk-adjusted for pre-revenue:** $31.3M × 5% execution probability = **$1.57M**

---

### Method 4: Venture Capital Method

**Target Exit Value (Year 5):**
- Conservative: $50M (10x revenue multiple)
- Optimistic: $150M (SaaS company with growth)

**Required Return:** VCs expect 10x return in 5 years

**Post-Money Valuation Today:**
- Conservative: $50M / 10 = **$5M**
- Adjusted for pre-revenue risk (50%): **$2.5M**
