# MITA Finance — End-to-End Test Matrix

> Audit date: **2026-07-08/09** · Target: production `https://mita-production-production.up.railway.app` (commit `d682f3f969a6`)
> "VERIFIED" = executed first-hand this session with the shown result. "NOT EXECUTED" = expected value derived from source; needs a test.
> Evidence scripts live in the auditor scratchpad: `remote_smoke_deployed.py` (30 checks), `audit_opus_e2e.py` (gap-filling), `capture500b.py` (500 bodies).

## B. Financial-logic deterministic cases (exact expected numbers)

Budget formula (`app/services/core/engine/budget_logic.py`): `income = monthly + additional`; `fixed_total = Σ fixed`; **`discretionary = income − fixed_total − savings_goal`** (savings clamped so discretionary ≥ 0); if `fixed_total > income` → `ValueError` → HTTP 400.
Dashboard (`app/api/dashboard/routes.py`): `balance = monthly_income − Σ(this-month txns)`; `spent = Σ(today txns)`.

| # | Scenario | Inputs | Expected (exact) | Actual | Result |
|---|----------|--------|------------------|--------|--------|
| B1 | Normal income + fixed + savings | income 6000, fixed {rent 1500, util 200}=1700, savings 400 | total_income **6000**, fixed **1700**, discretionary **3900**, savings **400**, 31 calendar days | exactly those; breakdown real tier-weighted (Σ≈2730, remainder unallocated) | ✅ VERIFIED |
| B2 | Dashboard baseline (post-onboarding, no spend) | above | balance **6000**, spent **0** | 6000 / 0 | ✅ VERIFIED |
| B3 | daily_targets are real (not fallback) | above | targets from `DailyPlan` rows, not income/30 weights | Groceries 13.57, Transport Public 25.57 (real) | ✅ VERIFIED |
| B4 | Create txn recalc | +42.00 today | balance **5958**, today spent **42**, calendar today.spent **42** | 5958 / 42 / 42 | ✅ VERIFIED |
| B5 | Edit txn recalc | 42→100 | balance **5900**, spent **100**, calendar **100** | 500 error | ❌ BLOCKED by DEF-002/001 |
| B6 | Delete txn recalc | delete the txn | balance **6000**, spent **0**, calendar **0** | 500 error | ❌ BLOCKED by DEF-001 |
| B7 | Persistence + recovery | logout → login → dashboard | prior state recovered exactly | balance 5958 recovered (txn still present because delete failed) — recovery itself works | ✅ VERIFIED (persistence) |
| B8 | Income fully consumed by fixed | income 2000, fixed {rent 2000}, savings 400 | discretionary **0**, savings clamped to **0** | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED (add unit test on `generate_budget_from_answers`) |
| B9 | Fixed exceed income | income 2000, fixed {rent 2500} | HTTP **400** `BUDGET_GENERATION_FAILED` ("Fixed expenses exceed income") | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED |
| B10 | Negative free after savings | income 3000, fixed 2800, savings 500 | discretionary **0**, savings clamped to **200** | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED |
| B11 | 30-day month | onboard in a 30-day month | 30 calendar days, all limit>0 | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED (server uses current month; test `build_calendar` directly) |
| B12 | February (28) | build_calendar year=2026 month=2 | 28 days | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED |
| B13 | Leap February (29) | build_calendar year=2028 month=2 | 29 days | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED |
| B14 | Mid-month onboarding | onboard on day 15 | calendar full month; remaining budget spread over remaining days (verify engine behavior) | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED |
| B15 | Txn on past day | spent_at = yesterday | counts in month balance, not today's spent | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED |
| B16 | Txn on future day | spent_at = tomorrow (≤ +1d allowed) | excluded from balance (`spent_at < now`) and today's spent | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED |
| B17 | Category overspend | spend > category daily limit | calendar day status flips to over/warning | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED |
| B18 | Decimal rounding | amount 23.755 | stored/So quantized to 2dp (ROUND_HALF_UP) | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED |
| B19 | Duplicate create | same txn twice | two rows (no dedupe on single create) — confirm intended | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED |
| B20 | Timezone boundary | spent_at near local midnight | assigned to correct day per user tz | — | ⬜ NOT EXECUTED |

> B8–B20 are best implemented as **unit tests** against `generate_budget_from_answers` and `build_calendar` (deterministic, no DB), plus a few API integration tests once DEF-001/002 are fixed.

## C. Flutter manual test cases (device/emulator — NOT executed; no Android SDK this session)

| # | Flow | Expected | Depends on |
|---|------|----------|-----------|
| C1 | App launch → register | account created, tokens stored in secure storage | — |
| C2 | Login | dashboard loads with real numbers | — |
| C3 | Onboarding | budget + calendar generated, `has_onboarded` persists | — |
| C4 | Dashboard | balance/spent/targets match backend | — |
| C5 | Calendar | per-day planned/spent/remaining shown; days clickable | — |
| C6 | Create transaction | dashboard + calendar recalc | works (create OK) |
| C7 | **View all transactions** | list shows txns | ❌ will fail (DEF-001) |
| C8 | **Edit transaction** | value recalcs | ❌ will fail (DEF-002/001) |
| C9 | **Delete transaction** | value returns to baseline | ❌ will fail (DEF-001) |
| C10 | Restart app | session + data persist | — |
| C11 | Logout | tokens cleared; revoked | backend verified |
| C12 | Re-login | same data recovered | backend verified (B7) |

## D. Flutter automation candidates
- Widget/unit: `TransactionModel` JSON (de)serialization against real API payloads; token refresh/interceptor in `api_service.dart`.
- Integration (`integration_test/`): full journey C1–C12 against a staging base URL via `--dart-define=API_BASE_URL=...`; gate C7–C9 on the DEF-001/002 fix.
- Contract test: assert Dart request/response models match FastAPI schemas for auth, onboarding, dashboard, calendar, transactions.

## E. Backend automated tests (Phase 7, this session)
- **Collection:** 617 tests, **0 import/collection errors** (venv, py3.12, pytest 8.3.3).
- **Focused pass:** `test_transactions_services.py` + `test_transactions_routes.py` → **4 passed** — *these pass while the same operations 500 in production* because the tests use a **sync** session and never exercise the async route wiring (see DEF-001). Treat as a coverage gap, not proof.
- **Full suite:** not completable in a bare environment — many tests require a live Postgres/Redis and some concurrency tests hang; bounded 5-min run reached ~5% then timed out. Some `security/test_api_endpoint_security.py` and `performance/test_database_performance.py` cases fail without infra.
- **Recommendation:** run the full suite in CI (`main-ci.yml`) with service containers; add async-wired integration tests for transactions list/get/update/delete.

## F. Flutter analyze (Phase 7)
- `flutter analyze` → **49 issues, 0 errors** (info/warnings only): `avoid_dynamic_calls`, deprecated `value`→`initialValue`, Sentry SDK deprecations, and unused `_getSampleGoals` (dead sample-data, not wired). Compiles clean.
