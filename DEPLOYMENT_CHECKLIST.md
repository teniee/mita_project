## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment

```bash
# Verify all tests pass
python3 -m pytest tests/

# Check code quality
flake8 app/
black --check app/

# Verify no secrets in code
git secrets --scan

# Check migration files
alembic history
```

### 2. Database Migration

```bash
# Backup database
pg_dump mita_production > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Verify migration
alembic current
```

### 3. Backend Deployment

```bash
# Pull latest code
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
export JWT_SECRET="..."
export SENTRY_DSN="..."

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Restart services
systemctl restart mita-api
systemctl restart mita-worker

# Verify health
curl https://api.mita.finance/health
```

### 4. Frontend Deployment

```bash
# Build Flutter app
cd mobile_app
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release  # For Android
flutter build ios --release  # For iOS

# Upload to stores
# - Google Play Console
# - Apple App Store Connect

# Deploy web version
flutter build web --release
firebase deploy
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Check API endpoints
curl -X GET https://api.mita.finance/api/dashboard \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Monitor logs
tail -f /var/log/mita/api.log

# Check error rates
# - Sentry dashboard
# - Application logs

# Verify database connections
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT count(*) FROM users;"
```

---

## Environment Variables Checklist

### Backend (.env)

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/mita
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-min-32-chars
SECRET_KEY=another-secret-key

# Optional but recommended
SENTRY_DSN=https://...@sentry.io/...
ENVIRONMENT=production
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://...
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...

# Firebase
FIREBASE_JSON={"type": "service_account", ...}
# or
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=/path/to/service-account.json
```

### Frontend (config.dart)

```dart
class Config {
  static const String apiUrl = 'https://api.mita.finance';
  static const String environment = 'production';
  // Other config...
}
```

---

## Rollback Plan

### If deployment fails:

1. **Database Rollback**
```bash
# Restore from backup
psql mita_production < backup_YYYYMMDD.sql

# Rollback migration
alembic downgrade -1
```

2. **Code Rollback**
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Restart services
systemctl restart mita-api
```

3. **Frontend Rollback**
```bash
# Revert to previous app version
# - Google Play: rollback to previous release
# - App Store: submit previous version for review
```
