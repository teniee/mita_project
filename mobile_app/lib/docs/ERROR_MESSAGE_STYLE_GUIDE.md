# Financial Error Message Style Guide for MITA

## Overview
This guide establishes standards for creating user-friendly, actionable error messages throughout the MITA financial application. All error messages should prioritize clarity, provide helpful guidance, and maintain the user's trust in our financial platform.

## Core Principles

### 1. User-Centric Language
- **Use plain English**: Avoid technical jargon and system errors
- **Be conversational**: Write as you would speak to a friend
- **Stay positive**: Focus on solutions rather than problems
- **Show empathy**: Acknowledge the user's frustration

**‚úÖ Good**: "We couldn't save your transaction right now. Your data is safe, and you can try again."

**‚ùå Bad**: "TransactionException: Database connection timeout occurred during INSERT operation."

### 2. Financial Context Awareness
- **Acknowledge financial sensitivity**: Users are dealing with money and personal data
- **Provide reassurance**: Emphasize data security and accuracy
- **Offer alternatives**: When primary actions fail, suggest other paths
- **Respect budgets**: Understand that financial limits have real consequences

**‚úÖ Good**: "This transaction would exceed your daily budget by $25.50. You can still proceed, or consider adjusting the amount."

**‚ùå Bad**: "Amount validation failed. Check input parameters."

### 3. Actionable Guidance
Every error message should tell users:
- **What happened**: Clear explanation without blame
- **Why it matters**: Context about the impact
- **What they can do**: Specific next steps
- **How to prevent it**: Tips for future success
