## 6. Critical Technical Recommendations

### **1. Fix Backend Consistency (CRITICAL)**
The backend cohort analysis using 3-tier system creates dangerous inconsistencies:
```python
# Current problematic backend logic
if income >= 7000: income_band = "high"      # Wrong!
elif income >= 3000: income_band = "mid"     # Wrong!
else: income_band = "low"                    # Wrong!
```

**Impact**: Users receive incorrect financial advice, potentially causing financial harm.

### **2. Implement Behavioral Precision**
```dart
// Add behavioral rounding for financial decisions
final behaviorallyRoundedIncome = _behavioralRound(monthlyIncome * 12);

double _behavioralRound(double amount) {
  // Round to nearest $500 for psychological comfort
  return (amount / 500).round() * 500.0;
}
```

### **3. Add Tier Transition Management**
```dart
// Detect tier changes and provide transition guidance
bool isNearTierBoundary(double income, IncomeTier currentTier) {
  final nextTierThreshold = getNextTierThreshold(currentTier);
  return (nextTierThreshold - income) / nextTierThreshold < 0.05; // Within 5%
}
```
