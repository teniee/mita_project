# MITA Production Budget Engine Implementation

## Overview

This implementation replaces all hardcoded financial data in the MITA app with intelligent, personalized budget calculations based on real user onboarding data. The system uses behavioral economics, income tier analysis, and location-based adjustments to create realistic, actionable daily budgets.

## Key Components

### 1. ProductionBudgetEngine (`/lib/services/production_budget_engine.dart`)

The core engine that transforms onboarding data into intelligent budget recommendations.

**Key Features:**
- **Daily Budget Algorithm**: Calculates personalized daily spending allowances using MITA's methodology
- **Category Budget Allocation**: Smart budget distribution based on user's actual expense patterns
- **Dynamic Budget Rules**: Adaptive rules that adjust based on spending patterns and behaviors
- **Personalization Engine**: Goal-oriented nudges and behavioral interventions
- **Regional Adjustments**: Cost-of-living adjustments for different locations

**Core Methodologies:**
- Uses 5-tier income classification (low, lowerMiddle, middle, upperMiddle, high)
- Implements MITA's redistribution theory with flexibility buffers (15% of daily budget)
- Applies behavioral economics principles for habit-aware adjustments
- Incorporates real user expense categories and amounts from onboarding

### 2. BudgetAdapterService (`/lib/services/budget_adapter_service.dart`)

Bridges the production budget engine with existing UI screens, providing seamless data transformation.

**Key Functions:**
- `getDashboardData()`: Generates main screen data using production calculations
- `getCalendarData()`: Creates calendar with personalized daily budgets
- `getBudgetInsights()`: Provides AI-powered financial insights
- `getDynamicAdjustments()`: Real-time budget adjustments based on spending
- `getDayDetailsData()`: Enhanced day-specific budget breakdowns

### 3. Integration Updates

**Main Screen (`/lib/screens/main_screen.dart`):**
- Replaced hardcoded income and budget targets with production calculations
- Added personalized financial health scoring
- Enhanced AI insights with real budget confidence metrics

**Calendar Screen (`/lib/screens/calendar_screen.dart`):**
- Replaced static daily budgets with dynamic calculations
- Added production budget engine as primary data source
- Maintained fallback to API and user-based generation

## Budget Calculation Logic

### Daily Budget Calculation

1. **Base Calculation**: Uses MITA's daily budget model
   - Available spending = Income × (1 - fixed_commitment_ratio - savings_ratio) ÷ 30 days
   - Fixed commitment ratios by tier: Low (65%), Lower-Middle (58%), Middle (52%), Upper-Middle (45%), High (40%)
   - Savings target ratios by tier: Low (5%), Lower-Middle (8%), Middle (15%), Upper-Middle (22%), High (30%)

2. **User Expense Integration**: 
   - Analyzes user's actual fixed expenses from onboarding
   - Adjusts available spending based on real housing, utilities, insurance costs
   - Increases confidence score to 95% when using real data

3. **Goal-Based Adjustments**:
   - Save More: +5% to savings, -5% from spending
   - Pay Off Debt: +8% to debt payments, -8% from spending
   - Investing: +6% to investments, -6% from spending
   - Budgeting: -3% from spending for increased awareness

4. **Habit Corrections**:
   - Impulse Buying: -15% spending, +30% buffer for flexibility
   - No Budgeting: -10% spending, +20% buffer
   - Credit Dependency: -20% spending, +40% buffer
   - Forgot Subscriptions: -5% spending, +2% for subscription tracking

5. **Location Adjustments**:
   - High cost areas (CA, NY, WA, MA): +25% housing, +15% food, +10% transportation
   - Low cost areas (TX, FL, etc.): -20% housing, -10% food, -15% transportation
   - Uses 70% location-sensitivity ratio (30% of spending unaffected by location)

6. **Date-Specific Adjustments**:
   - Weekends: +20% for higher spending patterns
   - Month-end (days 25+): -15% for budget tightening
   - Payday impulse control for users with impulse buying habits

### Category Budget Allocation

1. **Base Category Weights**: Income tier specific starting points
2. **User Expense Integration**: Blends 70% actual patterns with 30% recommended
3. **Goal Optimization**: Redistributes to priority categories based on goals
4. **Habit Adjustments**: Reduces problematic categories, increases protective categories
5. **Normalization**: Ensures total allocations sum correctly

### Dynamic Budget Rules

Generates adaptive rules based on:
- **Habit-Based Rules**: Impulse protection, budget awareness, credit limitations
- **Goal-Based Rules**: Savings protection, debt prioritization
- **Mid-Month Adjustments**: Overspending corrections, velocity-based adjustments
- **Emergency Reallocation**: Automatic redistribution for unexpected expenses
- **Temporal Rules**: Weekend adjustments, month-end tightening

### Personalization Engine

Creates comprehensive user profiles including:
- **Goal Nudges**: Specific encouragement for user's financial goals
- **Habit Interventions**: Behavioral techniques (24-hour rule, cash-only weeks)
- **Tier Strategies**: Income-appropriate financial strategies
- **Behavioral Nudges**: Loss framing, social proof, progress celebration
- **Success Metrics**: Personalized KPIs (savings rate, impulse days, adherence)

## Regional Cost-of-Living Data

Built-in multipliers for major regions:
- **Very High Cost**: Switzerland (1.6x), Norway (1.5x)
- **High Cost**: California (1.45x), New York (1.35x), Netherlands (1.25x)
- **Moderate Cost**: Canada (1.15x), Germany (1.10x), Illinois (1.05x)
- **Lower Cost**: Texas (0.95x), Spain (0.95x)
- **Default**: 1.0x for unspecified regions

## Data Flow Architecture

1. **Onboarding Data Collection**: 
   - Geographic: region, countryCode, stateCode
   - Financial: income, expenses array with categories and amounts
   - Goals: save_more, pay_off_debt, budgeting, investing
   - Habits: impulse_buying, no_budgeting, forgot_subscriptions, credit_dependency
   - Income Tier: Automatic classification based on income

2. **Budget Engine Processing**:
   - Calculates daily budget using MITA methodology
   - Applies all user-specific adjustments
   - Generates category allocations
   - Creates dynamic rules and personalization

3. **Adapter Service Translation**:
   - Converts engine output to UI-expected formats
   - Handles caching for performance (1-hour cache validity)
   - Provides fallbacks for offline scenarios
   - Generates sample data when needed

4. **Screen Integration**:
   - Main screen gets personalized dashboard data
   - Calendar screen gets daily-specific calculations
   - Day details get enhanced breakdown with insights

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: 1-hour cache for budget calculations to reduce computation
- **Fallback Strategy**: Multiple fallback levels (production → API → user-based → static)
- **Async Loading**: Non-blocking UI updates with background data refresh
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with meaningful user feedback

## Testing & Validation

Comprehensive test suite (`/test/production_budget_engine_test.dart`) covering:
- Daily budget calculations across income tiers
- Location-based adjustments
- Habit and goal-based modifications
- Category allocation logic
- Dynamic rule generation
- Edge cases and error handling
- Budget consistency validation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```dart
final budgetEngine = ProductionBudgetEngine();
final onboardingData = OnboardingState.instance;

// Calculate daily budget
final dailyBudget = budgetEngine.calculateDailyBudget(onboardingData: onboardingData);

// Calculate category allocations
final categories = budgetEngine.calculateCategoryBudgets(
  onboardingData: onboardingData, 
  dailyBudget: dailyBudget
);

// Generate dynamic rules
final rules = budgetEngine.generateDynamicRules(
  onboardingData: onboardingData,
  currentMonthSpending: currentSpending,
  daysIntoMonth: 15,
);
```

### Adapter Service Usage

```dart
final budgetService = BudgetAdapterService();

// Get dashboard data for main screen
final dashboardData = await budgetService.getDashboardData();

// Get calendar data
final calendarData = await budgetService.getCalendarData();

// Get insights
final insights = await budgetService.getBudgetInsights();
```
